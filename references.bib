	abstract = {Recent advancements in deep learning for healthcare and computer-aided laboratory services have sparked a renewed interest in making medical data more accessible. Elevating the quality of healthcare services and delivering improved patient care necessitates a knowledge base rooted in data-driven insights. Deep learning models have proven to excel in this regard, as they are specifically designed to embrace a data-driven approach. These models thrive on exposure to larger datasets, which enables them to continuously improve their performance. However, as healthcare organizations strive to aggregate clinical records onto central servers to construct robust deep learning models, concerns surrounding privacy, data ownership, and legal restrictions have emerged. Safeguarding sensitive medical data while harnessing collective knowledge from multiple healthcare centers is a challenging balancing act. One promising approach to address these concerns is the use of privacy-preserving techniques that allow for the utilization of data from multiple centers without compromising security. Federated learning (FL) is a technique that has emerged to enable the deployment of large machine learning models trained across multiple data centers without the necessity of sharing sensitive information. In this article, we present the most recent findings derived from a systematic literature review focusing on the application of federated learning in healthcare settings. This review offers insights into the current state of research and practical implementations of FL within the healthcare domain. By leveraging federated learning, healthcare institutions can harness the collective power of their data while upholding privacy and data security standards, ultimately leading to more effective and data-driven healthcare solutions.},

	abstract = {Modern mobile devices have access to a wealth of data suitable for learning models, which in turn can greatly improve the user experience on the device. For example, language models can improve speech recognition and text entry, and image models can automatically select good photos. However, this rich data is often privacy sensitive, large in quantity, or both, which may preclude logging to the data center and training there using conventional approaches.  We advocate an alternative that leaves the training data distributed on the mobile devices, and learns a shared model by aggregating locally-computed updates. We term this decentralized approach Federated Learning.  We present a practical method for the federated learning of deep networks based on iterative model averaging, and conduct an extensive empirical evaluation, considering five different model architectures and four datasets. These experiments demonstrate the approach is robust to the unbalanced and non-IID data distributions that are a defining characteristic of this setting. Communication costs are the principal constraint, and we show a reduction in required communication rounds by 10-100x as compared to synchronized stochastic gradient descent.},

              Arrhythmia constitutes a problem with the rate or rhythm of the heartbeat, and an early diagnosis is essential for the timely inception of successful treatment. We have jointly optimized the entire multi-stage arrhythmia classification scheme based on 12-lead surface ECGs that attains the accuracy performance level of professional cardiologists. The new approach is comprised of a three-step noise reduction stage, a novel feature extraction method and an optimal classification model with finely tuned hyperparameters. We carried out an exhaustive study comparing thousands of competing classification algorithms that were trained on our proprietary, large and expertly labeled dataset consisting of 12-lead ECGs from 40,258 patients with four arrhythmia classes: atrial fibrillation, general supraventricular tachycardia, sinus bradycardia and sinus rhythm including sinus irregularity rhythm. Our results show that the optimal approach consisted of Low Band Pass filter, Robust LOESS, Non Local Means smoothing, a proprietary feature extraction method based on percentiles of the empirical distribution of ratios of interval lengths and magnitudes of peaks and valleys, and Extreme Gradient Boosting Tree classifier, achieved an F
              1
              -Score of 0.988 on patients without additional cardiac conditions. The same noise reduction and feature extraction methods combined with Gradient Boosting Tree classifier achieved an F
              1
              -Score of 0.97 on patients with additional cardiac conditions. Our method achieved the highest classification accuracy (average 10-fold cross-validation F
              1
              -Score of 0.992) using an external validation data, MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. The proposed optimal multi-stage arrhythmia classification approach can dramatically benefit automatic ECG data analysis by providing cardiologist level accuracy and robust compatibility with various ECG data sources.},

	abstract = {A novel collaborative and continual learning across a network of decentralised healthcare units, avoiding identifiable data-sharing capacity, is proposed. Currently available methodologies, such as federated learning and swarm learning, have demonstrated decentralised learning. However, the majority of them face shortcomings that affect their performance and accuracy. These shortcomings include a non-uniform rate of data accumulation, non-uniform patient demographics, biased human labelling, and erroneous or malicious training data. A novel method to reduce such shortcomings is proposed in the present work through selective grouping and displacing of actors in a network of many entities for intra-group sharing of learning with inter-group accessibility. The proposed system, known as Orbital Learning, incorporates various features from split learning and ensemble learning for a robust and secure performance of supervised models. A digital embodiment of the information quality and flow within a decentralised network, this platform also acts as a digital twin of healthcare network. An example of ECG classification for arrhythmia with 6 clients is used to analyse its performance and is compared against federated learning. In this example, four separate experiments are conducted with varied configurations, such as varied age demographics and clients with data tampering. The results obtained show an average area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.819 (95\% CI 0.784–0.853) for orbital learning whereas 0.714 (95\% CI 0.692–0.736) for federated learning. This result shows an increase in overall performance and establishes that the proposed system can address the majority of the issues faced by existing decentralised learning methodologies. Further, a scalability demo conducted establishes the versatility and scalability of this platform in handling state-of-the-art large language models.},

This approach allows medical institutions to collaborate without exchanging raw patient data. We utilize the publicly available data from the PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2021, featuring diverse ECG databases, to compare the classification performance of three federated learning methods against both central training with data sharing and isolated training scenarios. We show that federated learning outperforms ECG classifiers trained in isolation. In particular, our findings demonstrate that a globally trained model fine-tuned to specific local datasets surpasses non-collaborative approaches. This shows that models trained in federation learn general features that can be tailored to specific tasks. Furthermore, federated learning almost matches the performance of central training with data sharing on out-of-distribution data from non-participating institutions. These results highlight the ability of federated learning in developing models that generalize well across diverse patient data, without the need to share data among institutions, thus addressing data privacy concerns.},

	abstract = {Deep learning has been increasingly utilized in the medical field and achieved many goals. Since the size of data dominates the performance of deep learning, several medical institutions are conducting joint research to obtain as much data as possible. However, sharing data is usually prohibited owing to the risk of privacy invasion. Federated learning is a reasonable idea to train distributed multicenter data without direct access; however, a central server to merge and distribute models is needed, which is expensive and hardly approved due to various legal regulations. This paper proposes a continual learning framework for a multicenter study, which does not require a central server and can prevent catastrophic forgetting of previously trained knowledge. The proposed framework contains the continual learning method selection process, assuming that a single method is not omnipotent for all involved datasets in a real-world setting and that there could be a proper method to be selected for specific data. We utilized the fake data based on a generative adversarial network to evaluate methods prospectively, not ex post facto. We used four independent electrocardiogram datasets for a multicenter study and trained the arrhythmia detection model. Our proposed framework was evaluated against supervised and federated learning methods, as well as finetuning approaches that do not include any regulation to preserve previous knowledge. Even without a central server and access to the past data, our framework achieved stable performance (AUROC 0.897) across all involved datasets, achieving comparable performance to federated learning (AUROC 0.901).},

However, its low prevalence (0.5\%) and resemblance to common diseases present challenges that may benefit from automated machine learning–based approaches. We aimed to develop machine learning models to detect HCM and to differentiate it from other cardiac conditions using ECGs and echocardiograms, with robust generalizability across multiple cohorts.Methods:Single-institution HCM ECG models were trained and validated on external data. Multi-institution models for ECG and echocardiogram were trained on data from 3 academic medical centers in the United States and Japan using a federated learning approach, which enables training on distributed data without data sharing. Models were validated on held-out test sets for each institution and from a fourth academic medical center and were further evaluated for discrimination of HCM from aortic stenosis, hypertension, and cardiac amyloidosis. Last, automated detection was compared with manual interpretation by 3 cardiologists on a data set with a realistic HCM prevalence.Results:We identified 74 376 ECGs for 56 129 patients and 8392 echocardiograms for 6825 patients at the 4 academic medical centers. Although ECG models trained on data from each institution displayed excellent discrimination of HCM on internal test data (C statistics, 0.88–0.93), the generalizability was limited, most notably for a model trained in Japan and tested in the United States (C statistic, 0.79–0.82). When trained in a federated manner, discrimination of HCM was excellent across all institutions (C statistics, 0.90–0.96 and 0.90–0.96 for ECG and echocardiogram model, respectively), including for phenotypic subgroups. The models further discriminated HCM from hypertension, aortic stenosis, and cardiac amyloidosis (C statistics, 0.84, 0.83, and 0.88, respectively, for ECG and 0.93, 0.94, 0.85, respectively, for echocardiogram). Analysis of electrocardiography-echocardiography paired data from 11 823 patients from an external institution indicated a higher sensitivity of automated HCM detection at a given positive predictive value compared with cardiologists (0.98 versus 0.81 at a positive predictive value of 0.01 for ECG and 0.78 versus 0.59 at a positive predictive value of 0.24 for echocardiogram).Conclusions:Federated learning improved the generalizability of models that use ECGs and echocardiograms to detect and differentiate HCM from other causes of hypertrophy compared with training within a single institution.},

	abstract = {Electrocardiogram (ECG) data classification is a hot research area for its application in medical information processing. However, insufficient data, privacy preserve, and local deployment are still challenging difficulties. To address these problems, a novel personalized federated learning method for ECG classification is proposed in this paper. First, a global model is trained with federated learning framework on multiple local data clients. Then, we use the global model and private data to train the local model. To reduce the feature inconsistency between global and private local data and for better fitting the private local data, a novel ”feature alignment” module is devised to guarantee the uniformity, which contains two parts, global alignment and local alignment, respectively. For global alignment, the graph metric of batch data is used to constrain the dissimilarity between features generated by the global model and local model. For local alignment, triplet loss is adopted to increase discriminative ability for local private data. Comprehensive experiments on our collected dataset are evaluated. The results show that the proposed method can be better adapted to local data and exhibit superior ability of generalization.},

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence and machine learning have led to prominent and spectacular innovations in various scenarios. Application in medicine, however, can be challenging due to privacy concerns and strict legal regulations. Methods that centralize knowledge instead of data could address this issue. In this work, 6 different decentralized machine learning algorithms are applied to 12-lead ECG classification and compared to conventional, centralized machine learning. The results show that state-of-the-art federated learning leads to reasonable losses of classification performance compared to a standard, central model (−0.054 AUROC) while providing a significantly higher level of privacy. A proposed weighted variant of federated learning (−0.049 AUROC) and an ensemble (−0.035 AUROC) outperformed the standard federated learning algorithm. Overall, considering multiple metrics, the novel batch-wise sequential learning scheme performed best (−0.036 AUROC to baseline). Although, the technical aspects of implementing them in a real-world application are to be carefully considered, the described algorithms constitute a way forward towards preserving-preserving AI in medicine.},

	abstract = {In this study, a weighted federated learning approach is proposed for electrocardiogram (ECG) arrhythmia classification. The proposed approach considers the heterogeneity of data distribution among multiple clients in federated learning settings. The weight of each client is dynamically adjusted according to its contribution to the global model improvement. Experiments on public ECG datasets show that the proposed approach outperforms traditional federated learning and centralized learning methods in terms of accuracy and robustness. On the client side, the suggested federated learning (FL) approach had an accuracy of 0.93, sensitivity of 0.98, specificity of 0.82, miss classification rate of 0.07, precision of 0.06, FPR of 0.01, and FNR of 0.01. FL has 0.98 accuracy, 0.99 sensitivity, 0.91 specificity, 0.02 miss classification rate, 0.10 precision, 0.01, FPR, and 0.01 FNR on the server. The server-side federated learning approach outperforms the client-side in accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, miss classification rates, and precision. The results indicate that the proposed weighted federated learning approach is a promising solution for ECG arrhythmia classification in a distributed environment. In short, the proposed federated learning approach applied to ECG arrhythmia detection aims to address privacy concerns and improve accuracy, while still maintaining the centralized framework and advanced algorithmic approach.},

	abstract = {Modern methods in artificial intelligence perform very well on many healthcare datasets, at times outperforming trained doctors. However, many assumptions made in model training are not justifiable in clinical settings. In this work, we propose a method to train classifiers for electrocardiograms, able to deal with data of disparate input dimensions, distributed across different institutions, and able to protect patient privacy. In addition, we propose a simple method for creating federated datasets from any centralized dataset. We use autoencoders in conjunction with federated learning to model a highly heterogeneous modeling problem using the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Beth Israel Hospital Arrhythmia dataset, the Computing in Cardiology 2017 challenge dataset, and the PTB-XL dataset. For an encoding dimension of 1000, our federated classifier achieves an accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score of 73.0\%, 66.6\%, 73.0\%, and 69.7\%, respectively. Our results suggest that dropping commonly made assumptions significantly complicate training and that as a result, estimates of performance of many machine learning models may overestimate performance when adopted for clinical settings.},

This study develops and validates such models for simultaneous prediction of 15 different common CV diagnoses at the population level. We conducted a retrospective study that included 1,605,268 ECGs of 244,077 adult patients presenting to 84 emergency departments or hospitals, who underwent at least one 12-lead ECG from February 2007 to April 2020 in Alberta, Canada, and considered 15 CV diagnoses, as identified by International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10) codes: atrial fibrillation (AF), supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), ventricular tachycardia (VT), cardiac arrest (CA), atrioventricular block (AVB), unstable angina (UA), ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), non-STEMI (NSTEMI), pulmonary embolism (PE), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), aortic stenosis (AS), mitral valve prolapse (MVP), mitral valve stenosis (MS), pulmonary hypertension (PHTN), and heart failure (HF). We employed ResNet-based deep learning (DL) using ECG tracings and extreme gradient boosting (XGB) using ECG measurements. When evaluated on the first ECGs per episode of 97,631 holdout patients, the DL models had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of {\textless}80\% for 3 CV conditions (PTE, SVT, UA), 80–90\% for 8 CV conditions (CA, NSTEMI, VT, MVP, PHTN, AS, AF, HF) and an AUROC {\textgreater} 90\% for 4 diagnoses (AVB, HCM, MS, STEMI). DL models outperformed XGB models with about 5\% higher AUROC on average. Overall, ECG-based prediction models demonstrated good-to-excellent prediction performance in diagnosing common CV conditions.},

	abstract = {Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) treatment often requires the use of digital cardiac data, which can be leveraged to improve patient outcomes in critical cases such as heart attacks. It can be challenging to compile a sizable volume of medical information from one place. To address these challenges, a novel end-to-end framework has been proposed that utilizes federated learning to ensure data availability. In this article, a new algorithm that employs deep learning is introduced for classifying Electrocardiogram (ECG) arrhythmias in a federated environment. The proposed approach integrates a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with a Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM)-based Auto-Encoder (AE) network. The AE network is employed for learning the characteristics of ECG arrhythmias signals, while the SVM identifies the signals based on the learned characteristics. The AE network comprises an encoding module that uses an LSTM network to extract high-level features from ECG arrhythmias signals and a decoding module uses the second LSTM network to reconstruct the signals from the extracted high-level features. The algorithm can accurately identify Normal (N), Right Bundle Branch (RBB), Left Bundle Branch (LBB), Premature Ventricular Contractions (PVC) heartbeats, and Atrial Premature Complexes (APC). By employing ten-fold cross-validation, the proposed method surpasses state-of-the-art techniques, achieving an accuracy of up to 95.57\% for noisy data and 99.12\% for clean data. Furthermore, the suggested approach contains an Explainable Artificial Intelligence (EAI) module to improve the interpretability of categorization findings, allowing medical professionals to make more precise and timely judgments. The framework has been verified and validated for ECG signal categorization, but it may also be used in a variety of other healthcare applications.},

	abstract = {The soaring popularity of smart devices equipped with electrocardiograms (ECG) is driving a nationwide craze for predicting heart abnormalities. Smart ECG monitoring system has achieved significant success by training machine learning models on massive amounts of user data. However, three issues arise accordingly: 1) ECG data collected from various devices may display personal characteristic variations, leading to non-independent and identically distributed (non-i.i.d.) data. These differences can impact the accuracy and reliability of data analysis and interpretation; 2) Most ECG data on smart devices is unlabeled, and data labeling is resource-consuming as it requires heavy-loaded labeling from professionals; 3) While centralizing data for machine learning can address above issues like non-i.i.d. data and labeling difficulties, it may compromise personal privacy. To tackle these three issues, we introduce a novel federated semi-supervised learning (FSSL) framework named FedECG for ECG abnormalities prediction. Specifically, we adopt a pre-processing module to better utilize the ECG data. Next, we devise a novel model based on ResNet-9 in FSSL to accurately predict abnormal signals from ECG recordings. In addition, we incorporate pseudo-labeling and data augmentation techniques to enhance our implemented semi-supervised learning. We also develop a model aggregation algorithm to improve the model convergence performance in federated learning. Finally, we conduct simulations on a real-world dataset. Experiments demonstrate that FedECG obtains 94.8\% accuracy with only 50\% of the data labeled. FedECG achieved slightly lower accuracy than traditional centralized methods in ECG monitoring, with a 2\% reduction. In contrast, FedECG outperforms the state-of-the-art distributed methods by about 3\%. Moreover, FedECG can also support unlabeled data and preserve data privacy as well.},

	abstract = {This paper brings deep learning at the forefront of research into time series classification (TSC). TSC is the area of machine learning tasked with the categorization (or labelling) of time series. The last few decades of work in this area have led to significant progress in the accuracy of classifiers, with the state of the art now represented by the HIVE-COTE algorithm. While extremely accurate, HIVE-COTE cannot be applied to many real-world datasets because of its high training time complexity in \$\$O(N{\textasciicircum}2{\textbackslash}cdot T{\textasciicircum}4)\$\$for a dataset with N time series of length T. For example, it takes HIVE-COTE more than 8 days to learn from a small dataset with \$\$N=1500\$\$time series of short length \$\$T=46\$\$. Meanwhile deep learning has received enormous attention because of its high accuracy and scalability. Recent approaches to deep learning for TSC have been scalable, but less accurate than HIVE-COTE. We introduce InceptionTime—an ensemble of deep Convolutional Neural Network models, inspired by the Inception-v4 architecture. Our experiments show that InceptionTime is on par with HIVE-COTE in terms of accuracy while being much more scalable: not only can it learn from 1500 time series in one hour but it can also learn from 8M time series in 13 h, a quantity of data that is fully out of reach of HIVE-COTE.},

	abstract = {Several studies underscore the potential of deep learning in identifying complex patterns, leading to diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. Identifying sufficiently large and diverse datasets, required for training, is a significant challenge in medicine and can rarely be found in individual institutions. Multi-institutional collaborations based on centrally-shared patient data face privacy and ownership challenges. Federated learning is a novel paradigm for data-private multi-institutional collaborations, where model-learning leverages all available data without sharing data between institutions, by distributing the model-training to the data-owners and aggregating their results. We show that federated learning among 10 institutions results in models reaching 99\% of the model quality achieved with centralized data, and evaluate generalizability on data from institutions outside the federation. We further investigate the effects of data distribution across collaborating institutions on model quality and learning patterns, indicating that increased access to data through data private multi-institutional collaborations can benefit model quality more than the errors introduced by the collaborative method. Finally, we compare with other collaborative-learning approaches demonstrating the superiority of federated learning, and discuss practical implementation considerations. Clinical adoption of federated learning is expected to lead to models trained on datasets of unprecedented size, hence have a catalytic impact towards precision/personalized medicine.},
